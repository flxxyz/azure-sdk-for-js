# This script is intended to update docs.ms CI configuration (currently supports Java, Python, C#, JS) in nightly build
# For details on calling, check `docindex.yml`. 

# In this script, we will do the following business logic.
# 1. Filter out the packages from release csv file by `New=true`, `Hide!=true`
# 2. Compare current package list with the csv packages, and keep them in sync. Leave other packages as they are.
# 3. Update the tarage packages back to CI config files.
